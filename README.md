# JavaParquet
Java project to read a locally stored parquet file. Can as an example be used whenever a .parquet file has to be downloaded from ADLS2 in order to show a preview in an application.

Added functionality to download the file first from adls2 and also create code snippets that can be pasted into DataBricks to work with the data.

Code taken and slightly changed to match required output from https://www.jofre.de/?p=1459
